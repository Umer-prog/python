## Introduction

Hey there! This repository is a bit of a diary for my Python learning adventure. I've been working through a course and adding all my projects and practice code here. It's not super polished or professional, but it's been a great way for me to track my progress and practice my skills.

## Basic Python Programs

This section contains all the simple scripts and programs I wrote when I was just starting out with Python. These include basic exercises and practice problems that helped me get the hang of Python syntax and concepts.

Happy coding!
